# Marvel
The Marvel app displays a list of Marvel characters with detailed information about them.

## Get Started
Marvel is designed to work with two API keys from [Marvel API](https://developer.marvel.com). You will need to get your free API keys after [creating an account](https://www.marvel.com/signin?referer=https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.marvel.com%2Faccount). Follow these instructions:

1. Get the API public and secret keys.
2. Insert into your Xcode schema by clicking the target icon at the top > "Edit Schema" > Within "Run", select "Arguments", and add your environment key values to the environment names of "API_Secret_Key" and "API_Public_Key".
3. Ensure you have signing capabilities enabled under the Project settings for the "Marvel" target.
4. Make sure your simulator is working on MacOS.
5. Run the app!

## Testing
All UI and Unit Tests are designed not to require any additional dependencies. Therefore, you simply run the test and observe the result.
